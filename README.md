# My Project Plan (Level 1 Heading)

**Note**: This document is written merely as an illustrative example, and does not provide any working guide to an actual project.

##Propsal (Level 3 Heading)
---
I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects objects in images. 
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=ko) or [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), and other open source softwares.

For example, the objects in the following images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):
